# Linear-Actuator
Arduino sketch using 2 relays to push and pull and a Linear Actuator
  - In this sketch, the signal pin for RELAY_1 is pin 4 on the arudino. The signal pin for RELAY_2 is pin 5 on the arduino. 
  - Since these relays operate at 5v, the power rails on the arduino will work for these relay modules
